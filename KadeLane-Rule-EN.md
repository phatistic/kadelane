# Rules and Regulations for Playing the Game "KadeLane"
## Preparation Before Playing
- Before starting the game, check how many players will be playing. Normally, **2-4** players can participate. Once ready, you will need to **create a field** with a size of **6×10** squares, and the edges of the field will be pits, which are divided as follows:

|Icon|Name|Item Upgrade Power                        |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|
|  ⚔️ | **Sword**| Item increases attack power by 1 unit    |
|  🍖 |**Meat**| Item increases health by approximately one unit|
|  🥤 |**Water**| Item increases movement power by two units (possibly including movement power from dice rolls)|

## Setup Before Starting
- Once everything is ready (if all players are ready), roll the dice in the first round to determine the highest value.
> The player who rolls the highest goes first.
> The player who rolls the lowest goes last.

* The preparation before starting includes:
      1. Players must find a spot to place their pieces on the field but 
         not on top of items, other players, or in the pits.
      2. After placing, choose the direction. If ready, let the next player prepare, and once everyone is ready, the game can start.

## Main Rules
   - After preparation is complete, and the game starts, each player begins with:

|Player📄    |Attack Power⚔️     |Movement Power🥤    |Health🍖   |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|
|Player 1🟥| 1 unit | 0 units | 5 units |
|Player 2🟦| 1 unit | 0 units | 5 units |
|Player 3🟨| 1 unit | 0 units | 5 units |
|Player 4🟩| 1 unit | 0 units | 5 units |

   - The rules for player movement are that each player has a marker on their head for setting their direction and aiming at other players for attacks.
     
   - Let's get started! Once it's your turn, roll the dice, and you can:
      * **Move forward**
      * **Move left**
      * **Move right**
      You can also **turn around**, but once you move in a round, you cannot undo or turn back.

## Execution
   - This section describes the execution phase, which includes:
### 1. Collecting Items After Movement
   After a movement round, collecting items will upgrade the player who steps on the item. As explained in point 1, the item collection system works as follows:
#### 1.1 Collecting the Sword Item
   After moving, the player can collect the sword item to increase attack power.
#### 1.2 Collecting the Meat Item
   After moving, the player can collect the meat item to increase health.

#### 1.3 Collecting the Water Bottle Item
   After moving, the player can use the water item to increase movement power, which can be combined with movement power from dice rolls.

### 2. Attacking Other Players After Movement
   > Here, we'll explain that if a player's marker is not aimed at another player at the end of the movement round, they cannot attack that player.
   > 
  - Let's discuss how attacking other players works:
  1. If a player moves close to another player at the end of their movement round, it is considered an attack.
  2. If a player attacks another player until their health is depleted or they are knocked off the field into a pit, the attacking player wins the game.

### 3. Knowing When to Win or Lose
- This section discusses how to determine the winner and loser:
   * If you attack other players until only one player remains on the field, that player is the winner, and the game ends.
 > You can request a restart or rematch.
