# Rules and Regulations for Playing KadeLane
## 1. **Preparation Before Playing**
- Before starting the game, check how many players will be playing. Typically, the game can be played with **2-4** players. After you’re ready, you need to **create a field** of size **6×10** squares, with the edge of the field consisting of pits divided as follows:

| Icon | Name     | Item Upgrade Power                      |
|------|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| ⚔️   | **Sword** | Increases attack power by 1 unit        |
| 🍖   | **Meat**  | Increases health by 1 unit              |
| 🥤   | **Water** | Increases movement power by 2 units (may also include power from dice rolls) |

## 2. **Before Starting the Game**
- Once preparation is complete (if there are players ready to play), roll the dice in the first round to find the highest number.
> The player with the highest roll will start first.
> 
The player with the lowest roll will play last.
* Preparation before starting includes:   1. Players must find a spot to place their player pieces on the field without overlapping items, other players, or pits.
2. After placing, determine the direction. Once ready, the next player should prepare, and if all are ready, the game can begin.
## 3. **Main Rules**
- After preparation, the game can start. Each player begins with the following stats:

| Player  | Attack Power⚔️ | Movement Power🥤 | Health🍖 |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| Player 1🟥 | 1 unit        | 0 units          | 5 units |
| Player 2🟦 | 1 unit        | 0 units          | 5 units |
| Player 3🟨 | 1 unit        | 0 units          | 5 units |
| Player 4🟩 | 1 unit        | 0 units          | 5 units |
- Players will have a marker on their heads to set their direction and aim to attack others.
- When it’s your turn, roll the dice. You can:   
 * **Move forward**   
 * **Move left**   
 * **Move right**   
 * **Turn around** (you can’t backtrack or reverse direction within the same turn)
 ## 4. **Gameplay in KadeLane**
 - This section describes the gameplay procedures:
 ### 1. Collecting Items After a Turn  
  - Collect items after a turn to upgrade your player if you land on them. This process is explained in Section
 1, but summarized here:
 #### 1.1 Collecting the Sword  
  - After a turn, collecting the sword increases your attack power.
  #### 1.2 Collecting Meat   
  - After a turn, collecting meat increases your health.
  #### 1.3 Collecting Water   
  - After a turn, collecting water increases your movement power, which can combine with dice roll movement.
 ### 2. Attacking Other Players After a Turn   
- If a player lands next to another after a turn, they can attack.   
- Attack conditions:      
1. If a player moves next to another player after their turn, it counts as an attack.      
2. If a player attacks and depletes another player’s health or knocks them into a pit, the attacking player wins the game.
### 3. Knowing Victory and Defeat
- Conditions for victory and defeat:   
* If a player eliminates all others and is the last one standing, they win the game.
> Players can request to restart or rematch.
